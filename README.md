iface
===


`iface` is a package containing interfaces for popular libraries that use raw structs.
This makes writing code that didn't originally support interfaces much simpler, in
particular for testing and refactoring (yay maintainability!).


For specific examples, please see sub directories. If you have set of interfaces that
you'd love to contribute, please open a PR!
